# ansible-playbooks-dcm4chee

Ansible playbooks to deploy a dcm4chee server.

## Ansible install

About the Ansible management node install you should follow this [link : Official Installation Guide](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html). This is fast and easy to do because there are not much dependencies.

I advise you to read the full documentation if you have not already done so.
